OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm that focuses on the concept of objects and classes, and the relationship between them. It is a powerful way of organizing code and making it easier to understand and maintain. OOP in C++ allows us to create classes that can be used to create objects with their own properties and behaviors. This makes it easier to create large, complex applications with more maintainable code. With OOP, code can be re-used and extended, making development more efficient. OOP in C++ uses classes and objects to represent real-world entities. 

This project was one of the most enjoyable experiences I have had while programming in C++. It was a project that focused on object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques, and it was a great way to hone my skills in this area. I was able to use the language's features to create objects and classes that encapsulated related pieces of data and behavior. I was also able to use inheritance and polymorphism to create an effective hierarchy of objects that could be reused in other parts of the project. Most importantly, I was able to use the fundamental principles of OOP to create a more organized and maintainable codebase. By creating objects and classes that could be reused throughout the project, I was able to reduce the amount of duplicate code and keep the project easier to manage. This was especially important for a project of this size, as it allowed me to quickly add new features and modify existing ones without having to rewrite a lot of code. Overall, this project was an excellent learning experience. By using object-oriented programming techniques, I was able to create a more organized and maintainable codebase that was also easier to read. This project has allowed me to become a more proficient and confident programmer, and I am grateful for the opportunity it provided
